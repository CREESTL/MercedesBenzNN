## Brief Summary ##

I've found a Mercedes-Benz dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing/notebooks) and decided
to create my own NN for regression task. 

So I want to train it to predict test time of each car from the dataset.
That is my first NN from scratch so... it is not as good

There are two files here: one is a standart `.py` and the other one is a `.ipynb` because I've been working
in Google Colab to get some free TPU and GPU power for training.
